# SP22-ITSE1479
Final Project for ITSE1479-Intro to Scripting Languages - Spring 2022
<hr/>
Be sure take a look at the sequence of actions that you should take to complete this lab as described in the Final Project Assignment in myTCC.

The goal is for you to 
<ol>
  <li>Successfully create a new function(s) that implements your determined action.</li>
  <li>Modify the main function jumpTable to successfully call your function(s), and</li>
  <li>Submit your new program and the modified collabITSE1479.py back to the GitHub repository.</li>
</ol>
If your changes are accepted, they will be added to the final source code on Github and appear on further fork that occurs from the main branch.

Start early and keep moving forward. Almost done.
